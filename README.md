# Caveman

Caveman is a a vector graphics editor. Its name is a tribute to our caveman ancestors, who created some of the oldest and most well-known art in the world.

## Building and Running

Currently, Caveman is only supported on Windows OS. To build and run Caveman using MSVC, run `do.bat compile run` from command prompt. Building first requires initializing the command prompt environment by executing `<vc-install>\VC\vcvarsall.bat x64`, where `<vc-install>` is your Visual Studio install directory. Note that `x64` is an argument to the script, not part of the script name.
